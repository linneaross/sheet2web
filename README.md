# sheet2web
Example Python program that reads a Google Spreadsheet and generates HTML from the content

In order to run this program, you will need to pip install the following packages:

 - google-api-python-client
 - google-auth-oauthlib
 - google-auth-httplib2

Look for the TODO labels in the python code.  You will need to supply the path to your own
OAUTH2 secrets file and the ID of the spreadsheet you wish to read.
